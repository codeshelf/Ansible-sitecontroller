This is the base role. It was written to Debian Jessie and is intended to be
used against a default image produced by the Devops team. It does not attempt
to remove "evil" configurations, so it is assumed you essentially 
"debootstrap'ed" a system from clean repositories on a clean build host!

Please set an appropriate SSH key for the Ansible user in tasks/main.yml!

# Ansible Sitecontroller
Welcome to the Codeshelf Basic Site Controller Provisioning Tool.

We use Ansible against localhost to set up a secure base platform.

Optionally, we also put the OS into "provisioning" mode with a set
of security keys and directives to "phone home" to the Codeshelf
Cloud. Be sure to read the README for each role!

Edit base.yml to use the base and/or provisioning roles.
